##General remarks
This repository contains functions for [Espacenet](https://worldwide.espacenet.com) which might be useful to others as well.

## Functions
### Notes for Espacenet
The first function is a __post-it functionality__, that allows you to store your notes inside an object called ["localStorage"](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
Feel free to edit them, use them and tell me if you wish to implement more stuff or if you find bugs (use ISSUE).

best regards,
Manuel
